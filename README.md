# Hotel-Management-System
We have developed a code to handle the production and distribution of a product. In this project, we have applied it to manage a hotel.  <br> The chef, waiter, and customer are modelled using thread. A customer will give an order to the waiter. The waiter will wake only when a customer arrives. Once the order is placed, the waiter will get pizza from the rack. If the pizza is not available, the waiter will wait. The chef will add pizza to the tray. The chef will remain if the tray is full.
