# Hotel-Management-System
We have developed a code to handle the production and distribution of a product. In this project we have applied it to manage a hotel.  Here the chef, waiter, customer are modeled using thread. A customer will give order to waiter. The waiter will wake only when a customer arrives. Once the order is placed, the waiter will get pizza from the rack. If the pizza is not available the waiter will wait. The chef will add pizza to the tray. Chef will wait if the tray is full.
